  def num_1
    #=== Example ================================
    # Sometimes you need to run the same chunk
    # of code over and over again.
    # Loops are a perfect solution for this problem.
    #============================================
    @phrase = "Are we there yet?"
    render 'num_1'
  end

  def num_2
    #=== Example ================================
    # We can combine these loops with HTML to
    # create formatted lists in a web page
    #============================================
    @phrase = "Are we there yet?"
    render 'num_2'
  end

  def num_3
    #=== Example ================================
    # We can add a 'block variable' to the times
    # method. In this case, the block variable
    # keeps track of what iteration of the loop
    # we're on
    #============================================
    @phrase = "Are we there yet?"
    render 'num_3'
  end

  def num_4
    #=== Example ================================
    # Suppose we want to say "I love [fruit name]" for
    # every fruit in this list:
    #============================================
    @fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "mangos"]

    render 'num_4'
  end

  def num_5
    #=== Problem ================================
    # Create a loop that prints out the statement
    # "red is my favorite color" for each color in the list,
    # replacing "red" with the appropriate color.
    # Use an unordered list.
    #============================================
    @colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]

    render 'num_5'
  end

  def num_6
    #=== Problem ================================
    # Create a loop that prints out each item on it's own line
    # in a numbered list
    #============================================
    @grocery_list = [
      "milk",
      "eggs",
      "bread",
      "cheese",
      "cereal"
    ]
    render 'num_6'
  end

  def num_7
    #=== Problem ================================
    # Print out each of the following names in a Bootstrap
    # linked list group
    #============================================
    @names = [
        "Caity Moran",
        "Neal Sales-Griffin",
        "Mike McGee",
        "Vince Cabansag",
        "Daniel Lopes"
      ]

    render 'num_7'

  def num_8
    #=== Problem ================================
    # Create profiles for each user using Bootstrap
    # media objects
    #============================================

  def num_9
    #=== Problem ================================
    # Write a program that outputs the lyrics to
    # 99 bottles of beer on the wall inside a
    # Bootstrap list group
    #============================================

    render 'num_9'
  end

  def num_10
    #=== Problem ================================
    # Create a form that asks for a starting year
    # and an ending year and then prints all the
    # leap years between them (and including them,
    # if they are also leap years).
    # Leap years are years divisible by 4 (like 1984
    # 2004). However, years divisible by 100 are
    # not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900) unless
    # they are also divisible by 400 (such as 1600 and
    # 2000, which were in fact leap years).
    #============================================

    # non-form solution

    @start_year = 1200
    @end_year = 1900


    render 'num_10'
